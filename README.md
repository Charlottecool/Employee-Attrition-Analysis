# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project analyzes employee attrition data to uncover insights and provide actionable recommendations for improving retention rates within a company. Using data from a synthetic dataset, this analysis explores key factors that influence employee attrition, including age, department, job satisfaction, salary, and tenure.

## Project Overview

The main goals of this analysis are to:
1. **Understand Attrition Drivers**: Identify factors that lead to higher attrition, such as salary levels, satisfaction rates, and work hours.
2. **Analyze Trends by Department and Position**: Examine job satisfaction and promotion rates by department and job title.
3. **Generate Insights for Retention Strategies**: Provide data-driven recommendations to help mitigate employee turnover.

## Key Findings

### Age Distribution
- Employee ages range from 25 to 59, with a fairly even distribution. Notably, the largest age group is 59, suggesting a need for succession planning as these employees approach retirement.

### Job Satisfaction
- Satisfaction levels vary by department and job title, with the **Sales department** showing the highest satisfaction and **Finance** the lowest. Managers exhibit the lowest satisfaction among job titles, suggesting areas for management development and support.

### Work Hours
- Employees average more than the standard 173 hours per month, which may indicate a high workload. Work-life balance initiatives could improve satisfaction and reduce attrition.

### Promotions and Salary
- **Promotion Rate**: Varies by department, with **Sales** seeing the highest promotion rate. Engineers are promoted the fastest, while Managers have slower promotion rates.
- **Salary Distribution**: Lower salaries correlate with higher attrition, especially for those earning around $30,000. Compensation adjustments could be a strategic approach to reducing turnover.

### Attrition by Generation
- **Millennials** show a higher attrition rate compared to **Gen X** and **Gen Z**, with more Millennials leaving than staying.

## Recommendations
Based on these findings, the following actions are recommended to reduce attrition:
- Implement structured promotion pathways based on tenure and performance.
- Adjust salaries to better reflect job responsibilities and departmental contributions.
- Encourage a healthier work-life balance by managing working hours around a 40-hour workweek standard.
